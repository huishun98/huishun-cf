# Hui Shun Coding Factory

![Web view](https://github.com/huishun98/huishun-cf/blob/master/assets/screenshot.png)

The purpose of this project is to create a WordPress theme that can help me document my coding journey. The bulk of the code here is from an open sourced github repo: https://github.com/mhoofman/wordpress-heroku. The new theme I made can be found here: https://github.com/huishun98/huishun.cf/tree/master/wp-content/themes/huishun-theme, and the live site can be found here: https://huishun-cf.herokuapp.com/.
